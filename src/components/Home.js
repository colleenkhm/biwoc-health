              <p>
                Hi! I'm Eada Talal Al-Soodani and I'm a mixed Arab from Saudi
                Arabia and white from the United States. I moved from Saudi to
                the US when I was ten with my 4 siblings. I identify as a Female
                and go by she/her pronouns.
                <br></br>I lived in a small town in Washington State and moved
                to Eugene, Oregon to get my Bachelor's degrees in Political
                Science at University of Oregon. I currently work at a Dispute
                Resolution Center as a Program Coordinator.
                <br></br>I started BIWOC health with my friend Sarah LaPlante
                because of my negative experience in healthcare. Like myself,
                many Black, Indigenous, and People of Color - Women have
                struggled with physical and mental health issues without getting
                the proper care they deserve and need.
                <br></br>
                My hope is to have our voices heard about the struggles we have
                gone through. I hope we can increase the amount of women in
                healthcare. I hope we can have justice for women's reproductive
                rights. I hope we can live in a country where we donâ€™t have to
                worry about our medical bill.
                <br></br>

              </h3>
              <p>

                and Research in hopes of contiuning to work towards equitable
                healthcare. Eada and Sarah first started working together as
                co-creaters of Mixed Student Union at the Universtiy of Oregon

                mixed. When Sarah is not working on completing her MSW and
                working for BIWOC Heatlh she spends time reading, traveling and
